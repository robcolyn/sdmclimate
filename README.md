# sdmclimate
A species distribution modelling pipeline developed for evaluating the climatic niche of a given species using an ensemble modelling framework.
The framework utilises presence-only data and requires the generation of background or psuedo-absence data. The framework includes model evaluation and validation components, as well as threshold selection options for converting models to binary outputs.
